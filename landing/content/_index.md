## About the Series

This tournament series is dedicated to development of the HEMA community in Serbia and neighboring countries by providing a dedicated space for growth of the competitors.

Usually, when the tournament is "open" and everyone competes in the same tier, many newcomers are in the situation when they are severely outranked and not only they can't fight for the medals, but also the experience is very limited because of the level difference. 
The same problem often arises from the lack of women's category.

To battle this issue, we came up with this series of touraments.
Every event is dedicated to one or two weapon styles, and will have "beginners" and "women's" categories. We are planning on holding up to 5-6 events every year in different clubs in Belgrade and Novi Sad.

So, here we aim to create a safe haven to grow, gain competition experience and test your skills. So give it a try, grow your own teeth, and let the big fish out there fear you!
